                <p>"A brand is not a logo. The logo may be part of a larger brand system, but the brand doesn’t end with that static mark. The
                    methods a company communicates visually have evolved along with technology. A single, unchanging logo, for many organizations, no longer makes sense as brands now represent themselves in stores, on billboards, online and on social media.
                    Over the next few weeks we’re going to think about branding beyond the logo or badge to think more holistically
                    about communication, narrative, and coherence. How does a brand adapt to each platform? How do they communicate or
                    display themselves differently in different formats? How has technology enables us to interact with brands differently?
                    In this project, you will develop a fictional organization and develop a flexible brand system for it. You’ll apply this
                    brand across various mediums and create guidelines specifying how the brand can and cannot be moved. Think about how a
                    brand can evolve over time, shifting its identity from context to context. Consider how you might develop a consistent 
                    personality or aesthetic while allowing room for flexibility and surprise.""

                        In the project, I wanted to create a brand / restuarant that reflects who I am through my culture. I wanted 
                        to somehow grasp the younger asian audience and to connect with them on an emotional level. When it comes 
                        to our grandparents and kimchi, it's a "feel-good" food that our grandparents makes for their grandchildren. though
                        on a darker scale, I asked my mother "who would make the kimchi when grandmas gone?" <br>
                        
                        this restuarant is supposed to help
                        people at the age of 15 to 40 to remember the good old times with a homey and comforting environment. <br>

                <p>"In collaboration with Core Interactive Studio: choose a piece of written dialogue at least 
                    50 words long â€” a quote, song lyrics, passage from a book, an interview, etc.

                    You will code one page that features this conversation with HTML/CSS." <br>
                    
                    Expressions is a project we based off of a song, album, commentary, etc. We needed
                    a text that was 50+ words and create a website for the text. I chose to use a song called
                    '2soon' by a musician named Keshi.

                    <p>These are the rough drafts of the website created through sketch <br>

                        I wanted to utilate the artist himself with the aesthetics of the song and lyrics.
                        the lyrics were dark and a heartbroken vibe which gave me the idea of choosing minimalism.
                        I also wanted to make the website interactive. So, you will be able to scroll through the lyrics 
                        while listening to the song through the coded mp3 player. If you click on the 
                        logo you will see a bio of the artist himself. Also, scrolling through the lyrics, some aree highlighted
                        through a hover where you will be able see a description of what the lyrics stand for. <br>

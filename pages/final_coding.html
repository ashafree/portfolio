                    "At this current moment, the entire world is experiencing a pandemic crisis. Due to the impact of COVID-19, many (if not all) people, places and entities have been negatively effected by having to close down stores, offices, suffer incredible losses of income, and feeling of social and physical isolation from others under quarantine.

                    Many operations have turned to remote, online and digital alternatives (even our class!)- communicating through video meetings, creating online social spaces to engage with others, moving to delivery and curbside pick up, and moving wares online as physical spaces shutdown.

                    Your final project will be creating an interactive landing page for a business or entity (person, place, topic, etc). The business or entity can be a real one effected by COVID-19 or a fictitious one. Think about how this business or entity can operate under the current conditions or help others navigate through the crisis.

                    What messaging or necessary information should be included in such a website? What is the function or cause of the page - will it be purely informational? Selling something? Asking others to donate to a cause? Engaging with a certain community?

                    This website should be mobile-friendly and interactive. You can consider using a public API to generate part of the content or using Javascript functions to prototype interactions." <br>

                    This project is based on a small shop called "ShopFluffy". It is a store that knits every piece of clothing by hand. I took my love of crocheting and the 
                    stores unique way of creating the clothes and combined the two. My website shows an interactive web page that shows music, youtube playlists, and downloadable PDF.

                    <p>These are the rough drafts of the website created through sketch <br>

                        This shows frames of what I wanted my websote to feature. This is an interactive webpage that includes a playlist,
                        youtube playlist, and a chat box for a community of people who are either bored or want to learn knitting. 
                        Because of this virus, many people are stuck at home and usually don't know what to do with all this free time. 
                        So, I wanted to use a "time-consuming" activity that will be fun and the end results will make you feel accomplished.
